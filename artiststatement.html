                    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
                        <p>I make art to express my love for pop culture and life. I let my imagination and creativity run wild when making these projects. With pop culture in mind, I want the viewer to either recognize or wonder where these characters may have come from. When it comes to my projects about life or nature, I consider them abstract with an unreadable concept through the use of various shapes and focus on composition. Each project has a concept that represents the subject matter of pop culture and life/nature.
I use software, such as Adobe Photoshop, to create my projects, bridging art and technology within my work. When creating a new project I decide on my subject matter, pop culture or life/nature. Once I decide, I brainstorm various ideas on how I want my project to look, thinking about composition and a way of grabbing the viewer's attention. I find inspiration for my work within various fan art and nature photography.
My most recent project "Eye of the Flower" is one of my abstract life pieces. It is a 1280 x 1240 digital image. I envision this piece to be projected on a wall with the lights turned off. This piece is my take on the idea of beauty being in the eye of the beholder. The images of the flower and the woman represent beauty. I wanted to emphasize on the colors so I made the woman monochrome and made her lips and the flowers stand out the most. When an audience views this project, I want them to wonder the possible meaning and give them the opportunity of speculation.
