                    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
                        <p>My work consist of mainly digital media art. Some projects I have done are video art, sound art and code art to name a few. I am still new to digital media art and its concepts but I think it is interesting and something I have enjoyed doing. For my project I mainly use Adobe software. In terms of my processes, I try to find and research other artists of the particular medium and try to gain inspiration from the examples I find. Since I am new to digital media, I create these projects because I am interested in gaining new knowledge about the software I use and how I can push my projects to the limit with what I know. 
	Specifically with my final composite project, I planned to make a composite image with random characters of different media, such as film and video games, in the setting of a historic painting, specifically landscapes. At first I had no idea what to for the final project but I did a little more research on random art and I found an artist who paints video game characters and merges them into historic paintings,giving me the idea to make a composite image with various characters from different media. I also planned to use pixelated characters to emphasize the fact that the images used are historic. Not only that but I wanted to make multiple composites to play around with the different characters I can put into other interesting landscapes.
